1. Create Block class

BLOCK {
  timestamp, 
  lastHash, 
  data, 
  hash
}

TDD: Test driven development approach 
- confidence in reliable code
- speed up the coding process 


2. Create Genesis Block 
  This is the starting / origin block of the chain 
  genesis() static function on the block class

3. Create Mine Block function 
  mineBlock() static function that mines a new block with 
    -timestamp, 
    -the hash from the last block, 
    -and data
